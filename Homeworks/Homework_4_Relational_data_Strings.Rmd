  This set of exercise is mostly taken from R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```


# Exercise 1

1.  Imagine you wanted to draw on a map the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination.
    What variables would you need? What tables would you need to combine?

    Answer: 
    
I would need to combine table flights and airports. I would need variable origin and dest from table flights. I would also need variable lat and lon from table airports to determine the location of the airport.

2.  We know that some days of the year are "special", and fewer people than usual fly on them. How might you represent that data as a data frame?
    What would be the primary keys of that table? How would it connect to the existing tables?

    Answer: 

The table would contain all the dates that are considered as "special". Its primary keys would be date which would be imported as variale year, month and day. These primary keys will then be connected to table flights through variable year, month and day.

# Exercise 2

1.  Add a surrogate key to `flights`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
flights <- 
      flights %>% 
      mutate(id = row_number())
    ```

2.  Identify the keys in the following datasets

    1.  `Lahman::Batting`
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r}
    library(Lahman)
    Batting %>% 
      count(playerID, yearID, stint) %>% 
      filter(n > 1)
    ```
    
    The primary keys are playerID, yearID, and stint.
    
    2.  `babynames::babynames`
    
    Answer: 
    
    The primary keys are year, sex, and name.

    3.  `nasaweather::atmos`
    
    Answer: 

    ```{r}
    library(nasaweather)
    atmos %>% 
      count(lat, long, year, month) %>% 
      filter(n > 1)
    ```

    The primary keys are lat, long, year, and month.

3.  Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the `Batting`, `Master`, and `Salaries` tables in the Lahman package.  
    (A diagram does not have to be a perfect picture. It can be tables with some explanation, or it can be a scanned image of your sketch.)

# Exercise 3

1.  Compute the average arrival delay by destination, then join on the `airports` data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here's an easy way to draw a map of the United States:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    airports %>%
      semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
      ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
        borders("state") +
        geom_point() +
        coord_quickmap()
    ```

    (Don't worry if you don't understand what `semi_join()` does --- you'll learn about it next.)

    You might want to use the `colour` of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
  flights %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      mutate(average = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T)) %>%
      inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(lon, lat, colour = average)) +
      borders("state") +
      geom_point() +
      coord_quickmap()
    ```

2.  Add the location of the origin _and_ destination (i.e. the `lat` and `lon`) to `flights`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa")) %>% 
      left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
      select(origin, dest, lat.x, lon.x, lat.y, lon.y)
    ```

3.  Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays? 

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
# The data was taken in 2013, so the age of a plane was calculated in terms of 2013.
planes1 <- planes %>% 
      mutate(age = 2013 - year) %>% 
      select(tailnum, age)
    
flights %>% 
  inner_join(planes1, by = "tailnum") %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  summarise(average_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, average_delay)) +
  geom_point()
    ```

The scatter plot doesn't indicate that there's a relationship between a plane's age and its delays.

4.  What happened on June 13 2013? Display the spatial pattern of delays, and then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
flights %>% 
      filter(!is.na(dep_time), month == 6, day == 13) %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>%
      summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay), n = n()) %>%
      filter(n > 5) %>%
      inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
      ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
        borders("state") +
        geom_point(aes(size = n, colour = delay)) +
        coord_quickmap()
    ```

There was a lot of delays on June 13, 2013 because large storms hit the U.S and the weather was too severe for flights to operate normally.

# Exercise 4

1.  Filter flights to only show flights with planes that have flown at least 100 flights.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
flights_100 <-
      flights %>% 
      group_by(tailnum) %>%
      count() %>%
      filter(n > 100)

flights %>%
  semi_join(flights_100, by = "tailnum") %>% 
    ```

2.  Combine `fueleconomy::vehicles` and `fueleconomy::common` to find only the records for the most common models.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
library(fueleconomy)
    vehicles %>% 
      semi_join(common, by = c("make", "model"))
    ```

3.  What does `anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))` tell you?
    What does `anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))` tell you?

    Answer: 

    It tells you the destinations of flights that don't have a match in table airports.

    It tells you the FAA airport codes that don't have a match in table flights.

4.  You might expect that there's an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you've learned above.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
    flights1 <-
      flights %>%
      filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>% 
      select(tailnum, carrier) %>%
      group_by(tailnum) %>%
      summarize(n = n_distinct(carrier)) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    
    flights %>%
      semi_join(flights1, by = "tailnum") %>% 
      select(tailnum, carrier) %>% 
      distinct() %>% 
      arrange(tailnum) %>% 
      inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
    ```

# Exercise 5

1.  Given the corpus of common words in `stringr::words`, create regular expressions that find all words that:  
    (Put the regular expression after "Answer: " below. Feel free to experiment in the r code chunks. We will grade only the regular expression you put after "Answer: ")

    1. Start with "y".  
    Answer: ^y
```{r}
str_view(words, "^y", match = TRUE)
```

    1. End with "x"  
    Answer: x$
```{r}
str_view(words, "x$", match = TRUE)
```

    1. Are exactly three letters long. (Don't cheat by using `str_length()`!)  
    Answer: (^...$)
```{r}
str_view(words, "(^...$)", match = TRUE)
```

    1. Have seven letters or more.

    Since this list is long, you might want to use the `match` argument to `str_view()` to show only the matching or non-matching words.  
    Answer: (.......)
```{r}
str_view(words, "(.......)", match = TRUE)
```

2.  Create regular expressions to find all words that:  
  (Put the regular expression after "Answer: " below. Feel free to experiment in the r code chunks. We will grade only the regular expression you put after "Answer: ")

    1. Start with a vowel.  
    Answer: ^[aeiou]
```{r}
str_view(words, "^[aeiou]", match = TRUE)
```

    1. That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching
       "not"-vowels.)  
    Answer: ^[^aeiou]+$
```{r}
str_view(words, "^[^aeiou]+$", match = TRUE)
```

    1. End with `ed`, but not with `eed`.  
    Answer: [^e]ed$
```{r}
str_view(words, "[^e]ed$", match = TRUE)
```

    1. End with `ing` or `ise`.  
    Answer: i(ng|se)$
```{r}
str_view(words, "i(ng|se)$", match = TRUE)
```

3.  Create regular expressions to find all words that:  
  (Put the regular expression after "Answer: " below. Feel free to experiment in the r code chunks. We will grade only the regular expression you put after "Answer: ")

    1. Start with three consonants.  
    Answer: ^[^aeiou]{3}
```{r}
str_view(words, "^[^aeiou]{3}", match = TRUE)
```

    1. Have three or more vowels in a row.  
    Answer: [aeiou]{3,}
```{r}
str_view(words, "[aeiou]{3,}", match = TRUE)
```

    1. Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.  
    Answer: ([aeiou][^aeiou]){2,}
```{r}
str_view(words, "([aeiou][^aeiou]){2,}", match = TRUE)
```

4.  From the Harvard sentences data, extract:

    1. The first word from each sentence.  
    (Assign this list of words to a variable called "first.words")  
```{r}
first.words <- str_extract(sentences, "[A-Za-z]+")
```

    1. All words ending in `ing`.  
    (Assign this list of words to a variable called "ing.words")
```{r}
x <- "\\b[A-Za-z]+ing\\b"
ing <- str_subset(sentences, x)
ing.words <- unique(str_extract_all(ing, x, simplify = TRUE))
head(ing.words)
```

    1. All plurals.  
    (Assign this list of words to a variable called "plural.words")
```{r}
x <- "\\b[A-Za-z]{3,}s\\b"
plural <- str_subset(sentences, x)
plural.words <- unique(str_extract_all(plural, x, simplify = TRUE))
head(plural.words)
```

5.   Switch the first and last letters in `words`.  
    (Note `words` here refer to the the corpus of common words in `stringr::words`. Assign this newly created corpus after switching to a variable called `words.switched`)
    
```{r}
words.switched <- str_replace(words, "^([A-Za-z])(.*)([a-z])$","\\3\\2\\1")
```

6.  Split up a string like `"apples, pears, and bananas"` into individual components.  
    (Assign this vector of strings to a variable called `fruits`. Make sure to convert this into a vector by doing "%>% .[[1]]")
```{r}
x <- "apples, pears, and bananas"
fruits <- str_split(x, ", *(and *)?")[[1]]
```
